When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	I can make an official version on the remote repository, while make some experiment versions locally, and I won't mess my works up.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Some works I do may not be the official version, and then I do not need to push to the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks is only used on the GitHub, nonetheless clone can be used on the Github to local, or local to local, and branches is used to create a new purpose.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	I can keep updating my codes from the last version, even if I do not have Internet connecting.
